## ofxEMD

ofxEMD is an addon for openFrameworks for calculating [Earth Movers Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance) (EMD). EMD is a measure of the [dissimilarity between two probability distributions](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/RUBNER/emd.htm), and the [original implementation](http://robotics.stanford.edu/~rubner/emd/default.htm) is by Yossi Rubner.

An example of its usage can be found [here](http://www.github.com/genekogan/Mosaic).
